Themes and plugins are both very important to the website's functionality. You can choose one theme, which will define the look and feel of your site. Your theme may also interact with various plugins, like adding a search bar if SimpleSearch is enabled. There is a wide variety of plugins, each of which add some sort of function to your site. The admin panel is actually a plugin itself.

! When going to add themes or plugins, if you get a message that you cannot connect to the gpm, you probably need to update Grav

## Themes

First, we need to choose a theme. To see a list of themes you can add, click on the _Add_ button at the top right of the Themes section on the admin panel.

!!! The [Themes chapter](https://learn.getgrav.org/16/themes) in the Grav documentation is very technical, but you may want to check out the section on themes in the [Adminstration Panel chapter](https://learn.getgrav.org/16/admin-panel/themes).

Each theme will include a link to its Readme file, and possibly a link to a demo website. These are both worth examining if you are considering using that theme. [Skeletons](https://getgrav.org/downloads/skeletons) are another helpful resource for understanding themes, as they provide sample pages for you to start out with. More information about working with skeletons can be found in the mini tutorials.

## Plugins

Some themes support certain plugins. Common suspects include Breadcrumbs, Pagination, SimpleSearch, Taxonomy List, and TNT Search. Ideally your chosen theme will have a detailed Readme that lists supported plugins. If it does not, I describe how to manually find out which plugins the theme uses in the mini tutorials. There are also many plugins that do not require theme support. The best way to find out how to use a plugin is to look through the provided Readme.

!!! The [Plugins chapter](https://learn.getgrav.org/16/plugins) in the Grav documentation is very technical, but you may want to check out the section on plugins in the [Adminstration Panel chapter](https://learn.getgrav.org/16/admin-panel/plugins).
