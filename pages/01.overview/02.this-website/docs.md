### What to Expect

This is not a reference guide to Grav. Grav has **very** thorough [documentation](https://learn.getgrav.org/16) which I strongly recommend using as a reference whenever you run into questions or problems. It is also worth looking over the documentation in general, but do not feel compelled to read all of it, and you certainly should not feel bad you do not understand all of it. Some of the documentation has very high-level information you will likely never need, and some of it may have information that will make sense once you have some more experience with Grav. As long as you are able to get Grav up and running, you will pick up knowledge and experience as you go. As with any complicated software, trying to learn everything all at once would be counter-productive.

This leads me to the purpose of this tutorial. Rather than a reference guide, it is an instruction manual to get you started with the basics you need to put together a simple website. If that is all you need, great! If not, you will be in a better position to use other reference materials to expand your knowledge and the capabilities of your website. Keep in mind, the fancier you want your website to be, the more work you will have to put into it.

I will include links to various references throughout the tutorial as they come up.

#### **Base Tutorial**

The base tutorial is the first one you will want to work through. This will walk you through setting up Grav and building a simple blog-style website.

#### **Mini Tutorials**

These tutorials will extend the base tutorial, using the framework we will have already buit. There is no need to do all of them - just pick whichever ones look like they might come in useful.
