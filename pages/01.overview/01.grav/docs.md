## What is Grav?

To quote the Grav documentation:

> Grav is a **Fast**, **Simple**, and **Flexible** file-based Web-platform.

If you have heard of Wordpress, Grav is very similar. It streamlines website building, allowing users to create their own without requiring previous coding knowledge or experience.

!!! The Grav documentation is very extensive. It is available **[here](https://learn.getgrav.org/16)**.

## Additional Resources

The most important resources are the Grav documentation and the markdown syntax section it includes, as Grav content is written in markdown.

HTML (Hypter Text Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) define the structure and style of webpages. Depending on what you do, it may be helpful to gain some familiarity with them. W3Schools has extensive reference and tutorial materials on both.

JavaScript is the programming language of HTML and the web, and PHP is a server scripting language. Essentially, both are programming languages that can be used to add dynamic and interactive behavior to a website. It is not necessary to learn either in order to work with Grav, but if you want to W3Schools also has excellent material.

Twig is a templating engine for PHP. Grav templates are written using HTML and Twig. If you decide to do any templating, you can use the much simpler Twig syntax instead of learning PHP.
