## What is a Skeleton?

- a skeleton uses a specific theme
- it provides pages and possibly configuration files for someone using that theme
- these files can be very helpful by giving you an idea of how you can use the theme
- you can look at the repo for a skeleton and get inspiration, or you can install a skeleton and replace pages from the admin panel

## Starting Grav With a Skeleton

- starting Grav with a skeleton package is especially great because the package will also include some plugins, so you don't have to hunt down specific ones or worse, figure out which you need
- only a few skeleton packages are offered with an initial Grav install from Reclaim Hosting/OU Create
- the corresponding demo sites are listed below

* [Twenty](https://demo.getgrav.org/twenty-skeleton/)
* [Resume](https://demo.getgrav.org/resume-skeleton/)
* [One Page](https://demo.getgrav.org/onepage-skeleton/)
* [Photographer](https://demo.getgrav.org/photographer-skeleton/)
* [Learn2 with Git Sync](https://demo.hibbittsdesign.org/grav-learn2-git-sync/)
* [Open Course Hub](https://demo.hibbittsdesign.org/grav-open-matter-course-hub/)
* [Open MultiCourse Hub](https://demo.hibbittsdesign.org/grav-skeleton-open-matter-multi-course-hub-site/)
* [Open Publishing Space](http://demo.hibbittsdesign.org/grav-open-publishing-quark/)

- it is worth checking out these websites before installing Grav
- if you know you want to use a theme/setup like one of them, choosing that package when installing Grav will make setup much easier

## Adding a Skeleton After Installation

- if you want a skeleton other than what is offered above or if you decide you want to use a skeleton after installing Grav, you still can
- find skeletons [here](https://getgrav.org/downloads/skeletons)
- it's pretty easy to see what theme they are using
- the pages are the most important bit
- there might be useful configuration options
- you'll probably have to figure out which plugins you need to use
- you can enter your file system and add the pages directly
	- grav install folder/user/pages
- or you can investigate the repository
- the yaml and markdown may be automatically formatted, but you can choose to view it raw, as well
- if you put the pages into your grav setup, you may wish to switch to expert mode to see how they do the frontmatter, just in case there are options that aren't shown in the user interface of the page editor
