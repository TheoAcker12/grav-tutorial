First, you need to make sure you have done theme inheritance as specified in the Basic Theme Customization chapter.

Advanced customization involves modifying templates, creating really basic templates based on existing templates (essentially modifying a template while allowing the original to also remain in use), and a little bit of working with blueprints.

Templates are written in a combination of html and twig. While you don't necessary need to know _a lot_ to make simple modifications, and you don't need to know everything going on in a template, you do need to understand enough to figure out where you need to make your changes.

As with the previous chapter, this requires you to use your file system.
