## What is Grav?
To quote the Grav documention:
> "Grav is a **Fast**, **Simple**, and **Flexible** file-based Web-platform."

If you have heard about Wordpress then you already have an idea of what Grav is.

## This Tutorial
Grav has **very** through [documentation](https://learn.getgrav.org/16). If you use Grav for your website, I would strongly recommend that you check this documentation out. You do not have to read all of it, but there is a lot of useful information. I will include links to specific pages of the documentation throughout the tutorial.

Given this documentation, why have a separate tutorial at all? If you have taken a look at the documentation by now, you may understand - it is thorough to the point of being intimidating. If you are just starting out with Grav, do not have previous experience with website builders, and/or want to keep it simple then this tutorial is for you. The documentation also focuses on working directly with the file system and command line. If you are an experienced coder you will probably love it. If you aren't... you probably won't.

This tutorial will focus on giving you the very basics you need to start working with Grav and setting you up to dive deeper if you decide to do so. This means that you will learn all about working with the admin panel, which is the standard user interface for building your website.
