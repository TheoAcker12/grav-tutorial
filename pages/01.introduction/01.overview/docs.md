## What is Grav?
To quote the Grav documention:
> "Grav is a **Fast**, **Simple**, and **Flexible** file-based Web-platform."

If you have heard about Wordpress then you already have an idea of what Grav is.

### Key points about Grav
* For a basic website, the setup is very fast and straightforward.
* The organization system is intuitive.
* Grav makes it easy to go "under the hood" if you want to do more customization.
	! This may require some knowledge of html and css.
* Grav itself has **very** thorough documentation.
* You can customize your website with themes and plugins.
* Some themes and plugins have good documentation. Some don't.

## This Tutorial
As mentioned above, Grav has **very** through [documentation](https://learn.getgrav.org/16). If you use Grav for your website, I would strongly recommend that you check this documentation out. You do not have to (and should not) read all of it, but you can browse through it to see what might be relevant to you. The first two chapters, Basics and Content, are the most likely to be useful.

Given this documentation, why have a separate tutorial at all? If you have taken a look at the documentation by now, you may understand - it is thorough to the point of being intimidating. If you are just starting out with Grav, do not have previous experience with website builders, and/or want to keep it simple then this tutorial is for you. The documentation also focuses on working directly with the file system and command line. If you are an experienced coder you will probably love it. If you aren't... you probably won't.

This tutorial will focus on giving you the very basics you need to start working with Grav and setting you up to dive deeper if you decide to do so. This means that you will learn all about working with the admin panel, which is the standard user interface for building your website.
